## Refactoring the Index.html File

Was presented with an index.html page that was already coded, and my challenge was to refactor the HTML so that not only was it more semantic with the elements, but also that it had better accessability. 

So, I replaced most of the div elements with semantic elements, i.e. header, section, footer, etc. I also made sure to add alt messages for all images used to help with accessability.
